        "description": "<p>Anguilla is a jewel in the Caribbean. The island's main appeal is its stunning beaches, combined with friendly inhabitants and an authentic island atmosphere that has been diminished on other Caribbean islands due to package tourism.</p><p>Although Anguilla is just 16 miles long and three miles broad, yet it is jam-packed with intriguing attractions and natural features from top to bottom. At 213 feet tall, Crocus Hill towering above the otherwise flat limestone terrain, and The Fountain, a massive underground cave that pours fresh water into Shoal Bay. Anguilla's most well-known historic landmarks include Sandy Hill's 18th century Dutch Fort, Old Salt Mine and Pumphouse, and the restored 1787 Wallblake House.</p><p>Music and boats are essential aspects of Anguilla culture, and they will nearly always be present at significant events on the island. The Anguilla Cultural Festival and Summer Festival are excellent opportunities to meet Anguillians and learn about their culture. A music festival called 'The Moonsplash Music Festival' offers both local and international musicians, as does the Tranquility Jazz Festival, which takes place every year. Anguilla Day, May 30th, commemorates the Anguillan Revolution. The island also hosts a famous summer festival that combines aspects of Carnival with good old summer fun!</p><p>Anguilla is a gourmet's dream with over 70 eateries. You'll have no trouble getting pizza, Creole, Asian fusion, or excellent French food on Anguilla; the only issue you could have is locating a cheap dinner. Pimms at the Cap Juluca resort is a remarkable French-Asian experience; the Koal Keel in the Olde Valley is an island supper classic. Catch the free launch to Scilly Cay for some grilled lobster and rum punch for a genuine Caribbean beach barbeque.</p>",

Although Montserrat is the only jurisdiction outside of Ireland where St Patrick's Day is an official government holiday, locals extend the celebration to a week. The Montserrat International Fishing Tournament and the Volcano Half Marathon are the island's most popular sporting events.</p><p>Goat water, a thick goat meat stew eaten with crusty bread rolls, is Montserrat's national cuisine. Most local eateries, on the other hand, provide a wide variety of basic meals. On most menus, fish, and chicken vastly outweigh red meat selections. At the same time, beverages such as handmade ginger beer, sorrel, and a range of juices produced from Montserrat's unique tropical fruits are popular. The majority of eateries are only open throughout the day, and the dress code is pretty relaxed.</p>",

Despite being thousands of miles distant from the European country, the island is a part of the Netherlands. It's perched above Mt Scenery, an active volcano. As a result, the terrain is lushly green, with gleaming villages dotting the mountain's perimeter. The island's economy revolves around tourism. Saba's international prominence has shifted to eco-tourism in the last decade.</p><p>The island of Saba has many restaurants, most of which provide excellent dining experiences for visitors. Of course, Windwardside and The Bottom have the majority of the eateries. However, several hotels and resorts across the island offer fantastic restaurants and bars for visitors to enjoy. Saba's diverse restaurant scene incorporates European, Caribbean, American, and Asian influences despite the island's tiny size. Calaloo soup, breadfruit, and curried goat are among classic delicacies that you should not ignore. Bars and lounges are open. However, they usually close about midnight or shortly after that.</p><p>The Summer Celebration, also known as Carnival, is the most popular festival on Saba. During this time, the entire island transforms into a riot of color, dance, and joy. During Carnival, Saba, like the rest of the Caribbean, gets quite busy. Saba Days, which features athletic events, dancing performances, and barbeque feasts, is another prominent Saba festival.</p>",

The country has only strong ties to the United States since it was the first to acknowledge the newly established United States of America as an independent country in an act known as the 'first salute.' The ties between the United States and the relatively small island were subsequently cemented when Franklin D. Roosevelt, the United States 32nd president, had ancestors from St Eustatius. Despite this, St Eustatius has a robust Dutch identity. It was recognized as a 'special municipality' of the Netherlands in 2010 after being a colony since 1636.</p><p>Although St Eustatius does not have its distinct cuisine, some delectable Creole (African-American) options are for those seeking something a little more exotic.

It comprises St Kitts (also known as St. Christopher Island) and Nevis, separated by a two-mile channel. The entire population is estimated to be around 52,000 individuals, the majority of whom are of African origin and were brought to the Caribbean during the colonial period of the 18th and 19th centuries to labor on plantations and sell agricultural commodities to Britain. Indeed, St Kitts and Nevis were among the earliest Caribbean islands Europeans colonized, gaining 'Mother of the West Indies.' Locals are happy to have broken free from the chains of slavery and colonialism while also embracing their diverse backgrounds, resulting in an intriguing cultural blend.</p><p>St Kitts and Nevis cuisine have a West Indian feel, with many ingredients grown on the islands. The main meat utilized in cooking is a goat, which is a traditional African meal. Because St Kitts and Nevis are islands in the Caribbean Sea, it's no surprise that fish is abundant.

Both the geographical area and population had gained independence from British control in 1983. It comprises St Kitts (also known as St. Christopher Island) and Nevis, separated by a two-mile channel. The entire population is estimated to be around 52,000 individuals, the majority of whom are of African origin and were brought to the Caribbean during the colonial period of the 18th and 19th centuries to labor on plantations and sell agricultural commodities to Britain. Indeed, St Kitts and Nevis were among the earliest Caribbean islands Europeans colonized, gaining 'Mother of the West Indies.' Locals are happy to have broken free from the chains of slavery and colonialism while also embracing their diverse backgrounds, resulting in an intriguing cultural blend.</p><p>St Kitts and Nevis cuisine have a West Indian feel, with many ingredients grown on the islands. The main meat utilized in cooking is a goat, which is a traditional African meal. Because St Kitts and Nevis are islands in the Caribbean Sea, it's no surprise that fish is abundant. Goat water stew, a tomato-based stew with goat meat, breadfruit (a football-sized, spiky green fruit), green papaya (a luscious, tropical fruit), and droppers (a doughy dumpling), is the country's most famous dish.</p>",

            "description": "<p>St Lucia is a small island country with a rich history. It was initially established by Europeans 350 years ago, and today's culture is a mash-up of individuals of European and African ancestry. Colonizing European powers were interested in this Caribbean island producing and exporting crops during the spice trade. However, tourism is now the island's primary economic activity.</p><p>St Lucia is a typical Caribbean island country, with weather and an energetic environment reflecting the island's way of life, commemorated via yearly festivals. Independence Day is a national holiday in St Lucia, where everyone comes together to celebrate their country's pride. In addition, huge crowds flock to the world-famous Jazz Festival. The Atlantic Rally for Cruisers, a three-week sailing event with a finish line on the island, is another festival that draws a large number of international tourists.</p><p>St Lucia's cuisine is a mix of French and British cuisines, as both countries claimed the islands over the ages. Bananas, mangoes, oranges, tangerines, avocados, and breadfruit are among the fruits used in the recipes, which have a Caribbean taste (a potato flavored and textured tropical fruit). Bouyon is St Lucia's most renowned meal, a stew-like dish made with saltfish (salt-cured fish) and vegetables including plantains (savory banana-like fruit), dasheen (a tuber similar to taro), and yams (another tuber plant).</p>",

On both sides of the island, visitors will notice various cultural influences, ranging from French haute cuisine to the Dutch language, in this one-of-a-kind Caribbean nation.</p><p>The people of St Maarten are proud of their country's position on an island in the Caribbean Sea. Annual boating events, such as the Regatta in March and the Alliance Race in November, whereby people across the continent attend. Spring Carnival is a significant festival on St Maarten, and it is celebrated on both sides of the island at the same time. It's exciting crossing over to the French side at this time to see how the celebrations differ, but both sides celebrate in typical Caribbean flair.</p><p>Although St Maarten is a small country, the food here is perhaps the most interesting because you can taste international quality cuisines, including France, the Netherlands, Italy, India, Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam. Naturally, the restaurants must serve traditional Caribbean cuisine, and because St Maarten is an island country, fresh fish and seafood are always available. Many options suit all budgets, and restaurants on St Maarten consistently provide high-quality food to their customers.</p>",

Although St. Martin is a single island, it is divided into two nations: Saint-Martin, a French overseas collectivity, and Sint Maarten, a Dutch province. Even though their respective administering countries influence each side's culture, the two sides have enough in common in terms of heritage and traditions that it can be difficult to tell where Saint-Martin ends, and Sint Maarten begins.</p><p>The Funeral Day of Martin le Miséricordieux (otherwise known as Saint Martin of Tours) is observed every year on November 11th. The feast was widely regarded as the best time for slaughtering 'Martinmas meat' from prime, fattened cattle, geese, and other livestock, as well as the completion of the arduous task of fall wheat planting (sowing). Hiring fairs were more common than usual, where agricultural employees might choose to look for other jobs, or others had to.</p><p>Orange Fever is a charming national cuisine restaurant in Saint Martin. The renowned sushi restaurant Moulin Fou is not far away, and each dish is a gourmet marvel. Tourists recommend the Vesna Taverna & Bagel House in the Simpson Bay region, with a vast range of sweets as its primary attraction. Its style is reminiscent of a traditional restaurant tavern, and the ambiance is always warm and inviting.</p>",

St Vincent and the Grenadines have grown steadily since then, eventually gaining independence in 1979.

For example, the Bequia Easter Regatta, a big boat race, is organized to honor the island's heritage. The annual Carnival, known as the Vincy Mas, celebrates the country's Caribbean ties. The Nine Days Christmas celebrations showcase traditional culture, while the Mustique Blues Festival is a beautiful example of a modern music festival in action.</p><p>It's no surprise that the country of St Vincent and the Grenadines, which is made up of 32 islands, is passionate about fish and seafood. On the first Friday of every month, the village of Barrouallie on St Vincent's west coast has a fish festival where visitors may sample the local specialty blackfish (pilot whale). Lambi (queen conch), lobster, squid, and octopus will also be available. Curried goat meat paired with baked breadfruit is the typical West Indian cuisine (a potato flavored and textured tropical fruit).</p>",

The British were the first to colonize the island in the 16th century, and they have remained British possessions ever since. However, the islands' closeness to North America makes them a popular vacation destination for Americans and Canadians, who help to keep the economy afloat. The island of Providenciales, which attracts at least 500,000 visitors each year, is home to about half of the population of around 45,000 people. We cannot claim traditional island culture to be extinct since the question is whether it ever existed in the first place.</p><p>The Turks and Caicos Islands are a tiny but beautiful set of islands that vigorously cherish their traditions. The Big South Regatta, a historic boat race across the islands, is one of the many water-based celebrations and events in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Valentine's Day Cup also pits miniature boats against their life-size equivalents in a race. Check out the Salt Cay Day or the long-running kite flying competition conducted across the islands for traditional island celebrations on dry land.</p>"
