At 213 feet tall, Crocus Hill towering above the otherwise flat limestone terrain, and The Fountain, a massive underground cave that pours fresh water into Shoal Bay. Anguilla's most well-known historic landmarks include Sandy Hill's 18th century Dutch Fort, Old Salt Mine and Pumphouse, and the restored 1787 Wallblake House.</p><p>Music and boats are essential aspects of Anguilla culture, and they will nearly always be present at significant events on the island. The Anguilla Cultural Festival and Summer Festival are excellent opportunities to meet Anguillians and learn about their culture. A music festival called 'The Moonsplash Music Festival' offers both local and international musicians, as does the Tranquility Jazz Festival, which takes place every year. Anguilla Day, May 30th, commemorates the Anguillan Revolution. The island also hosts a famous summer festival that combines aspects of Carnival with good old summer fun!</p><p>Anguilla is a gourmet's dream with over 70 eateries. You'll have no trouble getting pizza, Creole, Asian fusion, or excellent French food on Anguilla; the only issue you could have is locating a cheap dinner. Pimms at the Cap Juluca resort is a remarkable French-Asian experience; the Koal Keel in the Olde Valley is an island supper classic.

Martinique has the same political standing as any other EU member state due to this union, and arriving upon the island may give you an overpowering Gallic feeling. The terrible 1902 volcanic eruption, which is still regarded as one of the most destructive natural disasters of the twentieth century, was one of Martinique's most noteworthy occurrences.</p><p>Because of the close ties to France, the Martinique holidays generally overlap. Martinique observes Bastille Day, which commemorates the founding of the French Republic. Martinique's Beaujolais 'nouveau' celebrations in November, which mark the arrival of the first harvest of the grape that produces a punchy and fresh red wine, are popular. Martinique, however, has an authentic Caribbean culture, and the most fantastic celebration of the year is the four-day 'Vaval,' which is akin to Mardi Gras carnivals across the world.</p><p>There are restaurants all across Martinique, most at Fort de France or Trois-Illets, but there are plenty of other possibilities. La Bredas (Saint Joseph, Fort de France) serves Creole cuisine from 7: 30 p.m. to 11: 30 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. Coiba (a native selfish) paired with yam (a kind of cassava) stewed in Maidera (a fortified wine) sauce is one of the French dishes on the menu.</p>",
